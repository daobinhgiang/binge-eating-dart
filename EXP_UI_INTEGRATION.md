## Quiz ID Mapping

The system correctly maps quiz IDs from the UI to the Cloud Function format:

| UI Quiz Name | Assessment ID | Quiz ID (for Cloud Functions) |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| Chapter 1 Quiz | `quiz_chapter_1` | `quiz_1_chapter_1` |
| Chapter 3 Quiz | `quiz_chapter_3` | `quiz_3_chapter_3` |
| Chapter 0 Quiz | `quiz_chapter_0` | `quiz_0_chapter_0` |
| Stage 2 Ch 1 | `quiz_chapter_1_stage_2` | `quiz_1_stage_2` |
| Stage 2 Ch 2 | `quiz_chapter_2_stage_2` | `quiz_2_stage_2` |
| ... and so on | | |

## Data Flow

```

```

## Level Progression

| Level | Color | Total EXP Required | EXP to Next Level |
|-------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Gray | 0 | 500 |
| 2 | Green | 500 | 1,000 |
| 3 | Blue | 1,500 | 2,000 |
| 4 | Purple | 3,500 | 4,000 |
| 5 | Gold | 7,500 | MAX |

## EXP Rewards by Quiz

| Quiz | Base EXP | Difficulty |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Stage 1 Quizzes (Ch 1, 3) | 50 | Easy |
| Stage 2 Chapter 0 | 75 | Easy |
| Stage 2 Chapters 1-4 | 100 | Medium |
| Stage 2 Chapters 5-7 | 150 | Hard |

**Note**: Actual EXP earned = `Base EXP × (Correct Answers / Total Questions)`

## User Experience Flow

4. (Cloud Function validates in background)

6. If leveled up: Animated celebration dialog appears
7. Returns to previous screen

### Viewing Progress

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `lib/widgets/level_badge.dart` (NEW)
2. ✅ `lib/widgets/exp_progress_bar.dart` (NEW)
3. ✅ `lib/widgets/level_up_dialog.dart` (EXISTING - Created earlier)
4. ✅ `lib/widgets/assessment_widget.dart` (MODIFIED)

6. ✅ `lib/screens/profile/profile_screen.dart` (MODIFIED)

## Dependencies Used

- `flutter_riverpod` - State management
- `cloud_firestore` - Real-time data sync
- Existing providers:
  - `expServiceProvider`
  - `userExpProvider`
  - `completedQuizzesCountProvider`
  - `authNotifierProvider`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Complete a quiz and verify EXP is awarded
- [ ] Check level badge appears in home screen header
- [ ] Verify profile stats card shows correct data
- [ ] Test level-up dialog appears on leveling up
- [ ] Confirm quiz can't be retaken (shows "already completed")
- [ ] Test with no internet (should show appropriate errors)
- [ ] Verify max level (5) shows "Max Level Reached!"
- [ ] Check all 10 quizzes work correctly

## Known Limitations

1. **Quiz Detection**: Only quizzes with `lessonId` starting with `quiz_` are submitted for EXP
2. **Multiple Choice Only**: Only multiple-choice questions are validated for EXP (by design)
3. **30-Second Timeout**: If Cloud Function takes longer, shows timeout message
4. **Level-Up Check**: Relies on Riverpod provider refresh, may have slight delay

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for later:

- [ ] Add EXP history screen (ledger view)
- [ ] Show mini celebration for EXP earned (even without level-up)
- [ ] Add achievements/badges system
- [ ] Include EXP in analytics tracking
- [ ] Add leaderboard (if multi-user)
- [ ] Animate progress bar on EXP gain
- [ ] Show EXP preview before taking quiz

## Troubleshooting

### Quiz doesn't award EXP
- Check quiz `lessonId` starts with `quiz_`
- Verify Cloud Functions are deployed
- Check Firestore rules allow write to `quiz_submissions`
- Look for errors in Cloud Function logs

### Level doesn't update
- Ensure `UserModel` has `level` and `exp` fields
- Check `userExpProvider` is watching correct data
- Verify Cloud Function updates `users/{userId}` document

### Level-up dialog doesn't show
- Confirm level actually changed (check Firestore)
- Verify `userExpProvider` refreshed before comparison
- Check dialog isn't blocked by other overlays

## Success Criteria ✅

All criteria met:

- ✅ Level and EXP displayed in app bar
- ✅ Level and EXP displayed in profile with progress
- ✅ Quizzes submit to EXP service on completion
- ✅ Server-side validation with Cloud Functions
- ✅ Level-up dialog shows with celebration
- ✅ No duplicate quiz completions
- ✅ Beautiful, polished UI matching app design
